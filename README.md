    Hi everyone, Here is the take home project. Firstly I would like to thank you for giving me this opportunity, it was a really fun process from the start. It was a good experience and hopefully I will have the occasion to create more with you.. I'm happy to share with you the little project which I had fun to do. Minor thing to add, I didn't know when I started that K-12 school start from kindergarden. I would propably have designed something more fun and joyful than what it is but I believe that it stills gives you an idea of what I can do. Have a nice day and thank you again.
